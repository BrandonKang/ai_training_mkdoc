# Introduction to Vector Databases

- Vector databases store and search high-dimensional vectors generated by AI models  
- Their goal is to provide **fast**, **accurate**, **scalable** similarity search  
- Core use cases:  
    - **RAG**  
    - **semantic search**  
    - **recommendation systems**  
    - **anomaly detection**

# What Are Vectors?

- A vector is a list of numbers representing meaning or features  
- AI models convert text, images, audio, or video into embeddings  
- Similar items → vectors close in space  
- Example similarities/differences:  
    - “cat” ↔ “kitten” (similar)  
    - “car” ↔ “banana” (different)

# Why Vector Databases?

- Traditional databases cannot efficiently search high-dimensional vectors  
- Vector DBs support **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** search  
- ANN enables millisecond-level retrieval at billion scale  
- Benefits:  
      - Fast search  
      - High scalability  
      - Built-in indexing structures  
      - Real-time updates

# Key Operations

- Store vectors  
- Index vectors  
- Search using similarity metrics (cosine, dot product, Euclidean)  

![Vector Similarity Search](https://images.deepai.org/glossary-terms/cosine-similarity-4063640.jpg){ width="50%" }

- The output will produce a value ranging from -1 to 1, indicating similarity where -1 is non-similar, 0 is orthogonal (perpendicular), and 1 represents total similarity.

- Filter using metadata (tags, categories, user IDs)

# Popular Vector Databases

- **Milvus** – open-source, cloud-native  
- **Pinecone** – fully managed  
- **Weaviate** – plugin-based, modular  
- **Qdrant** – Rust-based, lightweight  
- **FAISS** – library for vector search (not a full DB)

# Vector Databases in RAG

- Acts as RAG’s memory engine  
- RAG workflow:  
      - Query → embedding  
      - Vector DB finds closest vectors  
      - Matched text fed into LLM  
- Enables factual, grounded responses

# When to Use a Vector Database

- You need semantic search  
- You handle multimodal data  
- You expect large-scale datasets  
- You need low-latency retrieval  
- Ideal for:  
     - RAG systems  
     - Chatbots  
     - Search engines  
     - Recommendation features
