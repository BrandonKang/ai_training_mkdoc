# Learning Paradigms Explained

**AI systems can learn in different ways** depending on how much supervision the data provides.  
Each paradigm offers different strengths, trade-offs, and typical use cases.

## Supervised Learning

- Trains on **labeled data** where both input (x) and target output (y) are known.
- Highest accuracy when high-quality labels exist
- Most widely used paradigm in real-world ML systems  
- Image classification (cat vs dog) / Regression (house price prediction)
- Speech recognition / Fraud detection

## Unsupervised Learning

Learns from **unlabeled data** by discovering hidden patterns or structure.

- No predefined targets  
- Finds meaningful clusters, groups, or latent representations  
- Useful when labels are unavailable or too costly  
- Clustering users or behaviors (e.g., K-means)  
- Customer segmentation / Embedding generation for retrieval

## Reinforcement Learning

- An **agent** learns by taking actions in an environment and receiving **rewards** or penalties.
- Learning through **trial and error**
- Policy improves over time based on reward signals  
- Suited for sequential decision-making  
- Game-playing (Atari, Go, StarCraft) / Robotics and autonomous navigation  
- Industrial control systems / Recommendation systems (bandit optimization)
